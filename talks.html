                <h2>The Ankler's Prestige Junkie LIVE with Katey Rich and Hugh Grant</h2>
                <p>Really cool to hear from Hugh Grant! He talked about how he's been more of a character actor in the past decade of his career and why he made the transition.

                <h2>In Conversation with Cate Blanchett</h2>
                <p>I will never forget this. Cate Blanchett has got to be one of my favorite people on Earth. She was so interesting and well spoken, I wish the conversation could have gone on the whole day!!</p>

                <p>Loved hearing from Alfonso Cuaron. I love his work so it was such a cool experience to hear him talk about his career and his "three amigos" friendship!</p>

                <h2>Microsession- How Technology Is Changing Cinema’s Future</h2>
                <p>It was very interesting to learn about the technology that goes into theaters. I didn't know the talk would be about movie theaters specifically, but really found it fascinating.</p>
