                <h2>Went Up the Hill</h2>
                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733;</em></p>
                <p>This was my first movie of the festival. The highlight of this film was that I sat in the row right in front of the cast and director. The movie itself wasn't my favorite, a very avant-garde re-telling of the Jack and Jill nursey rhyme. I much prefer Adam Sandler's 2011 version of Jack and Jill.</p>

                <p><em>&#9733;</em></p>
                <p>This movie was not what I expected it to be. I thought Orlando Bloom's performance was very good. However, this movie was not for me. Glad I saw it though!</p>

                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</em></p>
                <p>I really loved this film. It gave off the vibe of a warm cup of coffee on a cool fall day. I really enjoyed the personality of all the characters. I will definitely be recommending this movie to friends and family when it comes out to theaters/streaming services.</p>

                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; 1/2</em></p>
                <p>I laughed, I cried, and I got to see Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh in person. The movie was such a fun time and the story was beautiful. I will definitely be going to watch it again when it comes out in theaters.</p>

                <h2>Sketch</h2>
                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</em></p>
                <p>10/10 experience! I struck up a conversation with a man and woman who happened to be Tony Hale's publicists. They generously let me in to the Sketch cast's private red carpet in TIFF Lightbox. I got to meet Tony Hale and got a ticket to the premiere. I will truly never forget this experience. The film was very cute and will probably become a family movie staple for the younger generation.</p>

                <p>I knew nothing about this story going into the movie, and now I must read the book! I really enjoyed this film and will definitely be recommending it when it comes to the big screen.</p>

                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; 1/2</em></p>
                <p>This was probably one of my favorite films at the festival. It was such a fun midnight madness audience, and Tim Robinson & Paul Rudd were a hilarious duo. The Q&A with the cast was also really funny. Also, living for that fact that it has a 90% score on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

                <h2>Queer</h2>
                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733;</em></p>
                <p> This film gave off the vibe of a Wes Anderson film that did ayahuasca. I thought the performances were great and the cinematography was very beautiful. Although, there were a few things in the movie that I didn't really understand. I think this is the kind of movie you probably have to see more than once to understand everything that's going on. </p>

                <h2>SATURDAY NIGHT</h2>
                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</em></p>
                <p>I absolutely loved this movie. It's become one of my favorite, if not my favorite Jason Reitman film. After growing up watching SNL, I loved seeing the dramatic 90 minutes that led up to the first time SNL went on the air. I was fascinated seeing the way the set was constructed, how the cast and crew navigated the chaos, and the excitement mixed with nerves as they prepared to go live. The film captured the tension, the personalities, and the energy of that moment in history. I think Reitman did a great job balancing the drama with humor, making you feel like you were right there in the room as they brought this iconic piece of television to life. </p>

                <h2>The Friend</h2>
                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; 1/2</em></p>
                <p>The only thing I knew about this going into the theater was that the film included a dog. I wasn’t expecting such a somber story, watching a family and their dog cope with the loss of a loved one to suicide. It’s such a unique narrative, and I loved how Bill Murray’s character was able to inject a bit of humor into this tragic situation.</p>

                <h2>Millers in Marriage</h2>
                <p><em>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</em></p>
                <p>I’m a fan of Edward Burns, I like what he does with family dramas and how he uses a big ensemble cast. I really did like the story of this film but I think I was just not the target audience for it. The film follows three siblings in their 50’s, and they all have very complicated issues in their marriage. I loved the cast, I liked the story. There were just a couple times where the film was a little slow. But I just think it felt that way to me because I am not able to relate to what the characters are going through. Edward Burns talked after the screening and said that he wrote this film for people in his age group to have a “rom-com” that could be more relatable. I definitely think he achieved his goal!</p>
